Language Metrics
================
There are two possible approaches:

 1. We construct metrics that we say define 'academicness'
 2. We summarise words from the websites and then classify them through a user study.

I'll be presuming that we're doing #1 here.  #2 is hard to do without bias (due to institutions mentioning themselves).

Metrics
-------

 1. Semantic similarity using WordNet.  Requires a set of 'seed words' that are specifically academic 
 2. Similarity to a corpus of academic, or recreational, prose. (perhaps other websites that focus on these topics?)
 3. AMT could be used on the keywords extracted to rank them, and this data returned to the CSV
